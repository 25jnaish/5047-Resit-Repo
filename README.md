COMP5047 – 2025 Resit Coursework
Applied Software Engineering
Subsystem: Student Mobile App – Event Subscription

Overview
This repo contains all the work for my COMP5047 resit coursework. I’m developing part of the Student Mobile App, focusing on the feature that lets students subscribe to events. The main function I’m analysing and modelling is “Subscribe to Event.”

Everything needed for the coursework is stored here, including diagrams, notes, Papyrus files, and documentation.
